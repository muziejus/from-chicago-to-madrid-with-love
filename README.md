From Chicago to Madrid with Love
================================

From Chicago to Madrid with Love is a proposed course to be taught at the University of Chicago. The initial commit of this syllabus is as proposed. My thinking and approach to teaching literature has changed rather remarkably since I drew this up in 2008 or so, so this repository will be updated over time to reflect that.

This structure of this GitHub syllabus is based on Mark Sample's [Videogame Studies](https://github.com/samplereality/videogame-studies) syllabus, in how it is presented on GitHub.
